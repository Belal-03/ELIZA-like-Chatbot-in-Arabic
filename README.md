- Recognizes specific **keywords** or **patterns** in Arabic user input  
- Applies **transformation rules** to generate contextually relevant responses  
- Maintains a natural conversational flow with varied, repetitive replies  
- Supports an interactive loop, continuing conversation until the user decides to exit

## ⚙️ Features & Requirements

- Written entirely in **Python**  
- Handles **Arabic** text input and output  
- Uses **pattern matching** via regular expressions or string replacements  
- Implements **predefined sentence patterns** for response generation  
- Runs an interactive command-line conversation loop

## 💻 Usage

Run the Python script, start chatting in Arabic, and the chatbot will respond based on recognized patterns. Type a specific exit command (e.g., "خروج") to end the conversation.
